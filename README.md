# Spanish demography

As my first github repository a simple R script to simulate the spanish life expectancy at birth from 1908 to 2016 with data from human mortality database and the very appreciated collaboration of http://jdieramon.github.io 

This repository will contain (at least is my intention) files and scripts related with the Ph.D thesis I am actually working in, which is about demography, longevity and mortality models as part of a major topic on financial planning resources in the long term.
