# Spanish demography

As my first github repository, it will contain (at least is my intention) files and scripts related with the Ph.D thesis I am actually working in, which is about demography, longevity and mortality models as part of a major topic on financial planning resources in the long term.

The first attemp, to check it out, is the script 'eoper.R', a simple R script to simulate the spanish life expectancy at birth from 1908 to 2016 with data from the human mortality database and the very appreciated collaboration of http://jdieramon.github.io 

The script shows the following chart, where we can see both life expectancy at birth for men and women since 1908.

Actually, Spain is in 2nd place worlwide in life expectation (Japan in the first one), with a female rate of 85.7 years and a male rate 80.3; averaged 82.83; however is expected that for 2040 Spain will overtake Japan as the country with longest life expectation.
