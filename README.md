# Spanish demography

As my first github repository, it will contain (at least is my intention) files and scripts related with the Ph.D thesis I am actually working in, which is about demography, longevity and mortality models as part of a major topic on financial planning resources in the long term.

The first attemp, to check it out, is the script 'eoper.csv', a simple R script to simulate the spanish life expectancy at birth from 1908 to 2016 with data from the human mortality database and the very appreciated collaboration of http://jdieramon.github.io
